## The Lore
This was created as my Final year project during my Bachelor's degree. I followed the tutorial by clear code on youtube, and implemented some of my own additions like a new level, an ability to kill enemies, a pause menu and a leaderboard(stored only in the local database). I intend to add more levels and mechanics in the future(a double jump is on my mind)

## Controls
| Action | Key |
| :--- | :--- |
| Move Up | `W` or `Up Arrow` |
| Move Down | `S` or `Down Arrow` |
| Attack | `Spacebar` |
| Pause | `ESC` |
